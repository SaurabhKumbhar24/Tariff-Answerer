The tariff situation remains fluid. Initially during the trading day, we saw a noticeable risk-off reaction across North American equity markets, with both the benchmark S&P 500 Index and the S&P/TSX Composite Index down 2% at one point. In addition, we saw government bond yields move lower, with the Canadian 10-year government bond yield falling by nearly 20 basis points and reaching a yield of around 2.9%, a level last seen in September 2024.

However, markets partially reversed some of these moves as U.S. President Donald Trump announced that he and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum have reached a deal to delay the imposition of these tariffs for 30 days.

And in the afternoon, President Trump announced that he was also delaying the imposition of tariffs on Canadian goods for 30 days.

Macroeconomic uncertainty will likely continue to remain elevated in the near-term, and it remains to be seen whether the tariffs get scrapped after the 30-day period. In addition, it remains to be seen what President Trump opts to do with the proposed tariff on Chinese goods.
